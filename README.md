# check-product-id

Proposed Code Test 1

Client specs: We have product ID say it has 12 digital with format of xxxx-yyyy-zzzz (x, y, z are digital). I candidate to write code to verify user input product ID.

Specs interpretation as User Story: User will input a text in a TextInput, and when pressing submit button, input will be validated to comply with xxxx-yyyy-zzzz numeric format

## Stack

Jasmine.js is used to implement tests to corroborate that client especs are implemented correctly
